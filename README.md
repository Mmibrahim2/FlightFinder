# FlightFinder

Brief Project Description:
This application allows travelers to find the shortest flight path between two cities given the set of flights stored in the DOT format. To accomplish this, the application will utilize Djikstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm over an implementation of a graph data structure. Additionally, Prim’s algorithm will be used to allow the user to find a minimum spanning tree from the graph of flights.
